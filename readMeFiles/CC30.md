# Hash Table 

## Overview

This Hash Table implementation is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently. It is designed to provide quick access to values based on their keys, making it ideal for scenarios where fast data retrieval is required.

### Key Features

- **Set**: Store a key-value pair in the hashtable, handling collisions gracefully. If a key already exists, its value will be updated.
- **Get**: Retrieve the value associated with a given key. Returns `null` if the key does not exist.
- **Has**: Check if a key exists in the hashtable and return a boolean result.
- **Keys**: Get a collection of all unique keys currently stored in the hashtable.
- **Hashing**: Utilizes a custom hashing algorithm to map keys to specific locations in the data structure.

## [Unit Testing](../CodeChallengesTests/test30.cs)

the tests were written to prove the following functionality:

1. Setting a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
2. Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. Successfully returns a list of all unique keys that exist in the hashtable
5. Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
6. Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
7. Successfully hash a key to an in-range value
