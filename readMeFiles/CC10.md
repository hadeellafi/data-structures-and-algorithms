# Stack and Queue Implementation using Linked List

This code includes an implementation of a Stack and a Queue data structure using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism. The Stack and Queue classes provide methods for performing common operations on these data structures.

## Stack

The Stack class represents a (FILO) data structure. It supports the following methods:

- `Push(el)`:add to the top of the stack.
- `Pop()`: remove and returns the element from the top of the stack.
- `Peek()`: returns the value of the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
- `IsEmpty()`: returns a boolean whether the stack is empty or not.

## Queue

The Queue class represents a (FIFO) data structure. It provides the following methods:

- `Enqueue(el)`: adds to the back of the queue.
- `Dequeue()`: removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
- `Peek()`: returns the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- `IsEmpty()`: returns a boolean whether the queue is empty or not.

## [Unit Testing](../CodeChallengesTests/test10.cs)

The testing written to test these cases:

1.  Test case for when both lists are empty
2. Test case for when one list is empty
3. Test case for when both lists have the same size
4. Test case for when one list is bigger than the other
